## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pure JavaScript
- ChatGPT

### What I learned

This time I tried using help of AI to figure the card background. It did well but I had to adjust the style. Minding my last JS challenge, I've decided to first seek an example to take a leaf from. 

### Continued development

To keep learning from other examples.

### Useful resources

Nothing particular.
